BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE USING GCC IN LINUX
---------------------------------------------

SIGIL uses CMake to compile, so you will need to install it:

	sudo apt-get install cmake

Optionally, you may want to install a more visually-pleasing version of CMake. It's only really necessary when you run into CMake problems when trying to build SIGIL, so it's optional:

	sudo-apt-get install cmake-curses-gui

We depend on the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library:

	sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

We need OpenAL for audio:

	sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev

If you want to develop SIGIL applications using CodeBlocks, and want to use the CodeBlocks output console (such as in debug mode), you should install xterm, too:

	sudo apt-get install xterm

Next, we can download the SIGIL source code from GitLab.

	cd ~/
	sudo apt-get install git
	git clone https://gitlab.com/geoff-nagy/sigil.git

Navigate to SIGIL's root directory and type:

    cd deps

This is where CMake-based dependencies of SIGIL are located. We will use Git to acquire GLFW. (You can ignore the "pigu" and "freetype" folders.)

Type the following:

    git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git

Now back up into SIGIL's root directory and build everything:

	cd ../
	mkdir build-linux-gcc
	cd build-linux-gcc
	cmake ../
	make
	sudo make install

Importantly, libsigil.so is installed by default into /usr/local/lib. If this directory is not part of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable, your SIGIL applications will not run since libsigil.so will not be found during runtime when it is normally loaded.

One solution is to run the following command:

	sudo nano ld.so.conf

and add the line

	/usr/local/lib

to the file ld.so.conf. Then, close the file and run

	sudo ldconfig

and you should be good to go.

And you're done! Example projects for every supported compiler are provided in the "examples" folder.
